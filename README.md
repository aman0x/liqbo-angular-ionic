# liqbo-angular-ionic

### Description
This repository represents the `/www` folder from the Liqbo Apache Cordova application. It contains everything to run the application locally. There is no `bower.json` or `package.json` as this repo represents the final build of the application.

 ### Setup
To setup development locally, I recommend using `http-server`, it is a minimal node application that allows you to create an http server in whichever directory you are currently in.

- `npm install http-server -g`
- `git clone https://github.com/neilff/liqbo-angular-ionic.git`
- `cd liqbo-angular-ionic`
- `http-server`
- Navigate to `localhost:8080` (or whichever port you set)

### Technology Stack
- AngularJS
- Ionic Framework
